## Overview

The Trade Agent MCP Server provides a conversational trading interface for agents. It enables natural-language interaction with stock and crypto brokerages—agents can execute trades, query portfolio performance, and surface market insights by sending plain-English requests through the MCP protocol.

This server is **remote-only**—you don't need to run anything locally to connect. Just point your MCP-compatible agent platform to the URL above.
